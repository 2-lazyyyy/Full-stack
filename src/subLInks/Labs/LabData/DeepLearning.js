    paragraph : ["The primary objective of establishing the Deep Learning and Information Systems (DLIS) Research Lab at the University of Information Technology, Yangon, is to support faculty members and both undergraduate and postgraduate students in conducting advanced research in Deep Learning (DL), Machine Learning (ML), and information systems development. Additionally, the lab seeks to foster collaboration with reputable academic institutions and research organizations to facilitate joint research initiatives in these domains.",'A solid understanding of deep learning foundations and hands-on experience in training deep networks are crucial for advancing research and developing innovative technologies in DL, ML, and data analytics. Our lab is dedicated to cultivating the practical skills necessary for deep learning, machine learning, data analytics, information security, and the creation and deployment of intelligent information systems.',"Founded with the support of Rector Dr. Saw Sanda Aye, the DLIS Research Lab aims to create and implement machine learning and deep learning models that generate valuable insights and conduct research in information systems and software engineering. Our research theme, \"Performing Better with Data and Analytics,\" focuses on maximizing data advantages and driving transformative innovation across various industry sectors.","The DLIS lab is led by Dr. Kyawt Kyawt San and comprises a dynamic team of postdoctoral researchers, faculty members, and undergraduate, master's, and doctoral students. We aim to construct models of the world based on observations of past behaviors through the development and deployment of ML and DL methods and algorithms. This team also evaluates these approaches in real-world applications, successfully applying them across diverse fields, including healthcare, higher education, and social and industrial systems.","Our lab includes seven researchers, comprising three Ph.D. candidates and one postgraduate student. In alignment with the university's mission, the DLIS Lab is committed to providing students with exceptional education and practical skills."],
