    paragraph : ['Technology education needs to be kept up-to-date and to be innovated constantly. The Data Distribution Management (DDM) Research Lab stands as a testament to the power of gathering computer scientist together with a common purpose. The lab was the first data management research lab under the Faculty of Computer Science, University of Information Technology (UIT).','With the support of Rector Dr. Saw Sanda Aye, the DDM Research Lab was founded. Our theme is "Efficient Data Management on High Performance Computing". Dr. Nwe Nwe Myint Thein, head of the DDM Research Lab, Dr. Dim En Nyaung, Dr. Thet Thet Aung and Dr. Khin Su Su Wai who would work on the next big profitable outcomes for the data management and high performance computing sector.'],
